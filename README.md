# Sennosen
A framework for easy timeseries analysis experiments

## Motivation
Timeseries data analysis is an incredible topic. There are so many algorithms around and such a vivid community. Understand the underlying forces driving the macroscopic effect measured converts data into knowledge. Next, extrapolate these learnings enable users to reach one of the golden goal : data forecasting.

No matter the language used, many libraries have been and are still published to support such investigations. Often libraries are released aside with their published research papers or use cases are investigated and related by reaserchers into web blogs. A current trend for such data analysis blogs is to supply references to a Jupyter notebook to illustrate the purpose of the resaerch area. This enables a peer validation and allows reusability for the reader.

"But what if we want to experiment these methodologies on our own dataset ?""
"What if we want to combinate data treatments into a complex data pipeline ?"
"What if we need to saerch for the right approach applicable to our context of data ?"

This is Sen-no-sen's purposes:
- for the users : offer a data analysis experimentation playground with many tools that can be easily combined into analysis recipes
- for the researchers : give the possibilty to publish or demo their algorithm as ready-to-go analysis block
- for the curious : propose a framework to learn data analysis with hands-on aside with theoritical background thanks to the contextual documentation

## Why Sen-no-sen ?

Sen-no-sen (先の先); is a term taken from the japanese martial arts. It litteraly translates as "ahead" but is often extended to "initiave". In this context it means "to take the intiative (of the attack) just before the opponent initiates any movement".
During trainings each opponents throw their souls into the perception of every single movement, sign or intention to attack in order to react accordingly. The name sen-no-sen has been selected for this project as it aims to build a playground for forecasting and data timeserie analysis.
